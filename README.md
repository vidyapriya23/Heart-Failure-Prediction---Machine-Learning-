# Heart-Failure-Prediction---Machine-Learning-
In this project, I have imported the required libraries and packages to the prediction using machine learning algorithms and visualizing the different accuracies.

The project is about heart failure and it is binary classification, which means we either have 1 for death or 0 for survival.

In the first part, I have analyzed the dataset that I imported from kaggle with the different exploratory analysis techniques like data visualization and dataframes with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for both categorical and continuous variables.

Then I split the dataset for machine learning prediction using different classification algorithms.

Finally, visualized the different accuracies using a bar chart and compare between the different algorithms.
